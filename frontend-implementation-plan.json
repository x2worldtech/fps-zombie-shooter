Ensure each level requires substantially more XP than the previous configuration, with disproportionately higher costs at higher levels. The new thresholds must match the updated backend progression exactly to keep frontend level calculations, XP progress bars, and boundaries consistent with backend state."

Ensure the progress bar percentage, current/next level XP display, and level badge all reflect the new steeper thresholds without requiring component logic changes (the updated levelSystem.ts utilities should handle the calculation changes transparently)."
