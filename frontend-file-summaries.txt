{
  "frontend/src/App.tsx": "Root app component updated to include `profile` in the screen state union, pass `kills`/`headshots`/`shotsFired` through the game-over flow, wire the `PlayerProfile` screen, and pass `onShowProfile` to `MainMenu`.",
  "frontend/src/components/Game/WeaponViewModel.tsx": "First-person weapon view model with fully redesigned realistic weapon models — a Glock-style pistol with separate slide, ejection port, serrated grip, trigger guard, hammer, and sights; a Mossberg/Remington pump-action shotgun with long barrel, ventilated rib, wood stock with grain, pump forend with finger grooves, receiver with ejection/loading ports, and bead sight; and an AK-47 assault rifle with rectangular receiver, dust cover, charging handle, curved banana magazine with ribs, wood handguard and stock, gas tube, flash hider with prongs, and pistol grip with finger grooves. All models preserve existing recoil/reload animation logic, tier-based glow overlays, and gold sparkle effects.",
  "frontend/src/components/Game/GameScene.tsx": "Game scene updated to track `kills`, `headshots`, and `shotsFired` via refs during gameplay and pass all three values to the `onGameOver` callback for profile stat submission.",
  "frontend/src/components/ControlsScreen.tsx": "Controls reference screen listing all keyboard/mouse bindings in Borderlands toon style with a back button.",
  "frontend/src/components/GameOver.tsx": "Game-over screen that shows final score/wave/kill stats; authenticated users see the score submission form and stats-saved indicator, while unauthenticated users see a locked leaderboard notice prompting them to sign in — no score submission API call is ever made for unauthenticated users.",
  "frontend/src/components/Leaderboard.tsx": "Leaderboard screen displaying top-10 high scores with rank medals; includes a dashed-border notice at the top informing players that only scores from signed-in users are shown.",
  "frontend/src/hooks/useWaveSystem.ts": "Wave system hook with fixed 1-based wave numbering (starts at wave 1 with correct enemy counts), stable callback refs to prevent countdown interval from being cleared on re-renders, and proper cleanup of timers on unmount and game over.",
  "frontend/src/types/weapon.ts": "Weapon type definitions with added `upgradeTier` field to `WeaponState`, plus exported `UPGRADE_COSTS` array (2500/5000/10000) and `UPGRADE_DAMAGE_MULTIPLIERS` array (1x/1.5x/2x/3x) for the Pack-a-Punch system.",
  "frontend/src/hooks/useWeaponSystem.ts": "Weapon system hook extended with `upgradeTier` state (0–3), `upgradeWeapon()` function that increments tier and returns cost, and `getEffectiveDamage()` that applies the tier-based damage multiplier to base weapon damage.",
  "frontend/src/hooks/useEnemySystem.ts": "Enemy system hook that manages enemy state, spawning, damage, scoring, and pickups. Fixed the `damageEnemy` function to read enemy data synchronously from `enemiesRef` before any state update, eliminating the unreliable side-effect-in-updater pattern so that score and points are correctly awarded on every zombie kill.",
  "frontend/src/components/Game/PackAPunchMachine.tsx": "Animated Pack-a-Punch upgrade machine at fixed position [15,0,-12]; now additionally exports `PACK_A_PUNCH_HALF_W` and `PACK_A_PUNCH_HALF_D` constants so `FirstPersonCamera` can include the machine in its collision checks.",
  "frontend/src/components/Game/HUD.tsx": "HUD component extended with points display (top-right), floating yellow kill-point notifications near the crosshair, Pack-a-Punch interaction prompt (shows cost/affordability when near machine), upgrade success/failure messages, and weapon tier stars in the ammo display.",
  "frontend/src/components/Game/DesertEnvironment.tsx": "Desert scene renderer that now imports `PALM_TREE_POSITIONS` from proceduralGeometry and `PalmTree` from PalmTree, and renders all 10 palm tree instances in the scene alongside buildings, rubble, the Pack-a-Punch machine, and the mountain barrier.",
  "frontend/src/components/Game/EnemyMesh.tsx": "Renders fully redesigned CoD-style standard and boss zombie meshes using multi-segment procedural Three.js geometry; StandardZombie features a gaunt skull with sunken eye sockets, pale greenish-grey necrotic skin, torn dark clothing with blood accents, forward torso lean, outstretched reaching arms, and animated leg/arm walk cycle; BossZombie is 1.5x larger with an oversized deformed skull, glowing red emissive eyes, exposed rib/bone geometry on the chest, asymmetric bulky shoulders with bone spikes, elongated clawed arms, darker decayed skin, and a floating health bar — all existing hit flash, death fade, and wave bob animations are preserved.",
  "frontend/src/utils/levelSystem.ts": "New utility module that mirrors the backend XP threshold logic, exporting `levelXpThresholds`, `calculateLevel`, `getXpForCurrentLevel`, `getXpForNextLevel`, and `getProgressToNextLevel` for levels 1–55.",
  "frontend/src/hooks/useQueries.ts": "Extended with `useGetOrCreateProfile` (fetches/creates the authenticated player's profile via React Query) and `useUpdateProfile` (mutation to submit session stats to the backend), in addition to re-exporting `useLeaderboard`.",
  "frontend/src/components/MainMenu.tsx": "Main menu extended with optional Internet Identity auth UI (sign-in/sign-out button + truncated principal display in the top-right corner) and a \"MY PROFILE\" button that only appears when the user is authenticated.",
  "frontend/src/components/PlayerProfile.tsx": "New player profile screen displaying the authenticated user's level (1–55), XP progress bar, and all career stats (kills, rounds, headshots, shots fired, total points/XP) in the toon/desert design style with a back button.",
  "frontend/src/utils/proceduralGeometry.ts": "Procedural building/mountain data generator with seeded RNG; now also exports `generatePalmTreePositions()` (rejection-sampling function that places 10 palm trees avoiding buildings, the Pack-a-Punch machine, the mountain barrier, and the spawn area) and the pre-computed constant `PALM_TREE_POSITIONS`.",
  "frontend/src/components/Game/FirstPersonCamera.tsx": "First-person camera controller with WASD/mouse look, sprint, and jump; now imports `generateMountainCollisionAABBs` and merges the mountain ring AABBs into the collision detection loop, with the soft arena clamp tightened to radius 62 to match the mountain inner edge.",
  "frontend/src/components/Game/MountainBarrier.tsx": "New component that procedurally generates a full ring of rocky mountain peaks around the map perimeter using React Three Fiber; each peak is a distorted cone with layered ridge sub-peaks and boulder clusters, using flat-shaded `MeshStandardMaterial` in realistic stone/grey/ochre tones with back-face outline passes for visual depth.",
  "frontend/src/components/Game/PalmTree.tsx": "New React Three Fiber component that renders a single realistic palm tree with a tapered, ring-textured trunk (base at y=0), 8 curved drooping fronds fanning from the crown, a coconut cluster, and a ground-connecting base flare — all using MeshStandardMaterial with natural green/brown tones. Accepts `position` and `seed` props for deterministic per-tree variation."
