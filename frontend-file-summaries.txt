{
  "frontend/src/App.tsx": "Root app component updated to include `profile` in the screen state union, pass `kills`/`headshots`/`shotsFired` through the game-over flow, wire the `PlayerProfile` screen, and pass `onShowProfile` to `MainMenu`.",
  "frontend/src/components/Game/WeaponViewModel.tsx": "First-person weapon view model with fully redesigned realistic weapon models — a Glock-style pistol with separate slide, ejection port, serrated grip, trigger guard, hammer, and sights; a Mossberg/Remington pump-action shotgun with long barrel, ventilated rib, wood stock with grain, pump forend with finger grooves, receiver with ejection/loading ports, and bead sight; and an AK-47 assault rifle with rectangular receiver, dust cover, charging handle, curved banana magazine with ribs, wood handguard and stock, gas tube, flash hider with prongs, and pistol grip with finger grooves. All models preserve existing recoil/reload animation logic, tier-based glow overlays, and gold sparkle effects.",
  "frontend/src/components/Game/GameScene.tsx": "Main game scene that now fully wires the `useGameAudio` hook — gunshot plays on every weapon fire, player hit sound plays on damage, pickup chime plays on item collection, wave start/clear audio plays at phase transitions, ambient zombie growls play during active waves, and the AudioContext is unlocked on the first user interaction (click/keydown/mousedown).",
  "frontend/src/components/ControlsScreen.tsx": "Controls reference screen listing all keyboard/mouse bindings in Borderlands toon style with a back button.",
  "frontend/src/components/GameOver.tsx": "Game-over screen showing final stats; now waits for both authentication and actor readiness before attempting to save session stats, with retry-on-error support and proper loading/success/error feedback.",
  "frontend/src/components/Leaderboard.tsx": "Leaderboard screen displaying top-10 high scores with rank medals; now handles isError state with a graceful error message in addition to loading and empty states.",
  "frontend/src/hooks/useWaveSystem.ts": "Wave system hook with fixed 1-based wave numbering (starts at wave 1 with correct enemy counts), stable callback refs to prevent countdown interval from being cleared on re-renders, and proper cleanup of timers on unmount and game over.",
  "frontend/src/types/weapon.ts": "Weapon type definitions with added `upgradeTier` field to `WeaponState`, plus exported `UPGRADE_COSTS` array (2500/5000/10000) and `UPGRADE_DAMAGE_MULTIPLIERS` array (1x/1.5x/2x/3x) for the Pack-a-Punch system.",
  "frontend/src/hooks/useWeaponSystem.ts": "Weapon system hook extended with `upgradeTier` state (0–3), `upgradeWeapon()` function that increments tier and returns cost, and `getEffectiveDamage()` that applies the tier-based damage multiplier to base weapon damage.",
  "frontend/src/hooks/useEnemySystem.ts": "Enemy system hook that manages enemy state, spawning, damage, scoring, and pickups. Fixed the `damageEnemy` function to read enemy data synchronously from `enemiesRef` before any state update, eliminating the unreliable side-effect-in-updater pattern so that score and points are correctly awarded on every zombie kill.",
  "frontend/src/components/Game/PackAPunchMachine.tsx": "Animated Pack-a-Punch upgrade machine at fixed position [15,0,-12]; now additionally exports `PACK_A_PUNCH_HALF_W` and `PACK_A_PUNCH_HALF_D` constants so `FirstPersonCamera` can include the machine in its collision checks.",
  "frontend/src/components/Game/HUD.tsx": "HUD component displaying health bar, points, score, wave info, weapon ammo, Juggernog perk indicator, interaction prompts for Pack-a-Punch and Juggernog machines, and feedback messages — with `UPGRADE_COSTS` now properly imported via ES module import instead of `require()`, and `bg-black/50` replacing the deprecated `bg-opacity-50` class.",
  "frontend/src/components/Game/DesertEnvironment.tsx": "Desert scene renderer that now accepts `juggernogPurchaseCount` prop and renders the `JuggernogMachine` at the validated outdoor `JUGGERNOG_POSITION` alongside buildings, palm trees, Pack-a-Punch, and the mountain barrier.",
  "frontend/src/components/Game/EnemyMesh.tsx": "Renders CoD-style standard and boss zombie meshes with procedural Three.js geometry; both zombie types now rotate every frame in their `useFrame` loop to face the player using `Math.atan2(dx, dz)` on the XZ plane (Y-axis only, no pitch/roll), driven by a `playerPositionRef` prop. All existing walking animations, hit-flash effects, and death fade-out transitions are preserved.",
  "frontend/src/utils/levelSystem.ts": "Level system utility mirroring the backend's steep 55-level XP threshold array exactly (1,000 XP for level 2 up to 80,000,000,000,000,000 XP for level 55), with helper functions for current level, XP boundaries, and progress percentage.",
  "frontend/src/hooks/useQueries.ts": "React Query hooks for player profile — useGetOrCreateProfile fetches/creates the authenticated profile with proper actor-ready guards and principal-keyed cache, useUpdateProfile mutation submits session stats with actor readiness check and cache invalidation.",
  "frontend/src/components/MainMenu.tsx": "Fully redesigned main menu with full-screen banner background image, animated dust motes, parallax dune layers, walking zombie silhouettes, heat haze, screen flicker, pulsing title glow, large cel-shaded DESERT DEAD title in Bangers font, and styled Play/Leaderboard/Profile/Controls buttons with entrance animations and hover glow effects.

  "frontend/src/components/PlayerProfile.tsx": "New player profile screen displaying the authenticated user's level (1–55), XP progress bar, and all career stats (kills, rounds, headshots, shots fired, total points/XP) in the toon/desert design style with a back button.",
  "frontend/src/utils/proceduralGeometry.ts": "Procedural building/mountain data generator with seeded RNG; now also exports `getValidJuggernogPosition()` (validates against building AABBs to find an outdoor position) and the pre-computed constant `JUGGERNOG_POSITION` alongside existing palm tree and building utilities.",
  "frontend/src/components/Game/FirstPersonCamera.tsx": "First-person camera controller with WASD/mouse look, sprint, and jump; now imports `generateMountainCollisionAABBs` and merges the mountain ring AABBs into the collision detection loop, with the soft arena clamp tightened to radius 62 to match the mountain inner edge.",
  "frontend/src/components/Game/MountainBarrier.tsx": "New component that procedurally generates a full ring of rocky mountain peaks around the map perimeter using React Three Fiber; each peak is a distorted cone with layered ridge sub-peaks and boulder clusters, using flat-shaded `MeshStandardMaterial` in realistic stone/grey/ochre tones with back-face outline passes for visual depth.",
  "frontend/src/components/Game/PalmTree.tsx": "New React Three Fiber component that renders a single realistic palm tree with a tapered, ring-textured trunk (base at y=0), 8 curved drooping fronds fanning from the crown, a coconut cluster, and a ground-connecting base flare — all using MeshStandardMaterial with natural green/brown tones. Accepts `position` and `seed` props for deterministic per-tree variation.",

Includes prefers-reduced-motion accessibility guard.",
  "frontend/src/hooks/useJuggernogSystem.ts": "New custom hook managing Juggernog perk purchase state — tracks purchase count (0–2), max health (100/150/200), and provides `purchaseJuggernog` (validates cost, deducts points, updates HP) and `resetJuggernog` functions.",
  "frontend/src/components/Game/JuggernogMachine.tsx": "New React Three Fiber component rendering a red toon-shaded vending machine labeled JUGGERNOG with animated glow, floating red particles, glass panel, and grayed-out state when maxed out at 2 purchases.",
  "frontend/src/utils/audioSynthesis.ts": "Web Audio API synthesis utilities with fixed AudioContext management — `getAudioContext()` now returns `null` (instead of a suspended context) when audio isn't ready, all synthesis functions guard against null context, and `unlockAudio()` is exported to properly `await` the resume Promise from a user gesture.",
  "frontend/src/hooks/useGameAudio.ts": "Game audio hook wrapping all synthesis functions with memoized callbacks; now also exports `resumeAudio` which calls the new `unlockAudio()` export from audioSynthesis to properly resume the AudioContext after a user gesture."
