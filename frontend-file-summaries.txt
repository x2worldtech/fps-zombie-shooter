{
  "frontend/src/App.tsx": "Root app component updated to include `profile` in the screen state union, pass `kills`/`headshots`/`shotsFired` through the game-over flow, wire the `PlayerProfile` screen, and pass `onShowProfile` to `MainMenu`.",
  "frontend/src/components/Game/WeaponViewModel.tsx": "First-person weapon view model with fully redesigned realistic weapon models — a Glock-style pistol with separate slide, ejection port, serrated grip, trigger guard, hammer, and sights; a Mossberg/Remington pump-action shotgun with long barrel, ventilated rib, wood stock with grain, pump forend with finger grooves, receiver with ejection/loading ports, and bead sight; and an AK-47 assault rifle with rectangular receiver, dust cover, charging handle, curved banana magazine with ribs, wood handguard and stock, gas tube, flash hider with prongs, and pistol grip with finger grooves. All models preserve existing recoil/reload animation logic, tier-based glow overlays, and gold sparkle effects.",
  "frontend/src/components/Game/GameScene.tsx": "Main game scene component that wires together all game systems (weapons, enemies, waves, audio, HUD); now passes `playerPosRef` (a `MutableRefObject`) to each `EnemyMesh` so zombies can read the latest player position every frame for accurate rotation toward the player.",
  "frontend/src/components/ControlsScreen.tsx": "Controls reference screen listing all keyboard/mouse bindings in Borderlands toon style with a back button.",
  "frontend/src/components/GameOver.tsx": "Game-over screen showing final stats; now waits for both authentication and actor readiness before attempting to save session stats, with retry-on-error support and proper loading/success/error feedback.",
  "frontend/src/components/Leaderboard.tsx": "Leaderboard screen displaying top-10 high scores with rank medals; now handles isError state with a graceful error message in addition to loading and empty states.",
  "frontend/src/hooks/useWaveSystem.ts": "Wave system hook with fixed 1-based wave numbering (starts at wave 1 with correct enemy counts), stable callback refs to prevent countdown interval from being cleared on re-renders, and proper cleanup of timers on unmount and game over.",
  "frontend/src/types/weapon.ts": "Weapon type definitions with added `upgradeTier` field to `WeaponState`, plus exported `UPGRADE_COSTS` array (2500/5000/10000) and `UPGRADE_DAMAGE_MULTIPLIERS` array (1x/1.5x/2x/3x) for the Pack-a-Punch system.",
  "frontend/src/hooks/useWeaponSystem.ts": "Weapon system hook extended with `upgradeTier` state (0–3), `upgradeWeapon()` function that increments tier and returns cost, and `getEffectiveDamage()` that applies the tier-based damage multiplier to base weapon damage.",
  "frontend/src/hooks/useEnemySystem.ts": "Enemy system hook that manages enemy state, spawning, damage, scoring, and pickups. Fixed the `damageEnemy` function to read enemy data synchronously from `enemiesRef` before any state update, eliminating the unreliable side-effect-in-updater pattern so that score and points are correctly awarded on every zombie kill.",
  "frontend/src/components/Game/PackAPunchMachine.tsx": "Animated Pack-a-Punch upgrade machine at fixed position [15,0,-12]; now additionally exports `PACK_A_PUNCH_HALF_W` and `PACK_A_PUNCH_HALF_D` constants so `FirstPersonCamera` can include the machine in its collision checks.",
  "frontend/src/components/Game/HUD.tsx": "HUD component extended with points display (top-right), floating yellow kill-point notifications near the crosshair, Pack-a-Punch interaction prompt (shows cost/affordability when near machine), upgrade success/failure messages, and weapon tier stars in the ammo display.",
  "frontend/src/components/Game/DesertEnvironment.tsx": "Desert scene renderer that now imports `PALM_TREE_POSITIONS` from proceduralGeometry and `PalmTree` from PalmTree, and renders all 10 palm tree instances in the scene alongside buildings, rubble, the Pack-a-Punch machine, and the mountain barrier.",
  "frontend/src/components/Game/EnemyMesh.tsx": "Renders CoD-style standard and boss zombie meshes with procedural Three.js geometry; both zombie types now rotate every frame in their `useFrame` loop to face the player using `Math.atan2(dx, dz)` on the XZ plane (Y-axis only, no pitch/roll), driven by a `playerPositionRef` prop. All existing walking animations, hit-flash effects, and death fade-out transitions are preserved.",
  "frontend/src/utils/levelSystem.ts": "Level system utility mirroring the backend's steep 55-level XP threshold array exactly (1,000 XP for level 2 up to 80,000,000,000,000,000 XP for level 55), with helper functions for current level, XP boundaries, and progress percentage.",
  "frontend/src/hooks/useQueries.ts": "React Query hooks for player profile — useGetOrCreateProfile fetches/creates the authenticated profile with proper actor-ready guards and principal-keyed cache, useUpdateProfile mutation submits session stats with actor readiness check and cache invalidation.",
  "frontend/src/components/MainMenu.tsx": "Main menu extended with optional Internet Identity auth UI (sign-in/sign-out button + truncated principal display in the top-right corner) and a \"MY PROFILE\" button that only appears when the user is authenticated.",
  "frontend/src/components/PlayerProfile.tsx": "New player profile screen displaying the authenticated user's level (1–55), XP progress bar, and all career stats (kills, rounds, headshots, shots fired, total points/XP) in the toon/desert design style with a back button.",
  "frontend/src/utils/proceduralGeometry.ts": "Procedural building/mountain data generator with seeded RNG; now also exports `generatePalmTreePositions()` (rejection-sampling function that places 10 palm trees avoiding buildings, the Pack-a-Punch machine, the mountain barrier, and the spawn area) and the pre-computed constant `PALM_TREE_POSITIONS`.",
  "frontend/src/components/Game/FirstPersonCamera.tsx": "First-person camera controller with WASD/mouse look, sprint, and jump; now imports `generateMountainCollisionAABBs` and merges the mountain ring AABBs into the collision detection loop, with the soft arena clamp tightened to radius 62 to match the mountain inner edge.",
  "frontend/src/components/Game/MountainBarrier.tsx": "New component that procedurally generates a full ring of rocky mountain peaks around the map perimeter using React Three Fiber; each peak is a distorted cone with layered ridge sub-peaks and boulder clusters, using flat-shaded `MeshStandardMaterial` in realistic stone/grey/ochre tones with back-face outline passes for visual depth.",
  "frontend/src/components/Game/PalmTree.tsx": "New React Three Fiber component that renders a single realistic palm tree with a tapered, ring-textured trunk (base at y=0), 8 curved drooping fronds fanning from the crown, a coconut cluster, and a ground-connecting base flare — all using MeshStandardMaterial with natural green/brown tones. Accepts `position` and `seed` props for deterministic per-tree variation.",
  "frontend/src/hooks/useLeaderboard.ts": "React Query hook for leaderboard data that throws (instead of returning empty array) when actor is unavailable, includes identity in query key for proper cache invalidation on auth changes, and exposes isError state."
