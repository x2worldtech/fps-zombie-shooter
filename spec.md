# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Improve the FPS weapon view models by adding realistic first-person hands/arms for all three weapons and redesigning the shotgun and pistol models to be more realistic using Three.js geometry.

**Planned changes:**
- Add visible first-person hands and arms to the pistol view model (right hand gripping handle with forearm, one-handed grip style)
- Add visible first-person hands and arms to the shotgun view model (both hands with forearms, pump-action grip style)
- Ensure the assault rifle retains correctly positioned hands and arms
- Redesign the pistol model with distinct slide, barrel, frame/grip, trigger guard, and magazine base (Glock-style proportions)
- Redesign the shotgun model with a long barrel, pump forend, receiver body, stock, and trigger guard (Mossberg 500-style proportions)
- Use consistent skin-toned mesh for all hand/arm geometry across all three weapons
- Ensure all animations (idle, aim, fire, reload) and upgrade tier glow overlays continue to work after model changes

**User-visible outcome:** Players will see realistic-looking hands and arms holding each weapon in first-person view, with a more detailed and recognizable pistol and shotgun model that better matches real-world firearm silhouettes.
