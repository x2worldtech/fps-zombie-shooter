The root cause is likely in audioSynthesis.ts or useGameAudio.ts – ensure the Web Audio API AudioContext is properly created, resumed after a user gesture (browsers require a user interaction before audio can play), and that all synthesized sound callbacks are wired up and invoked at the correct game events in GameScene.tsx.",
