  "summary": "EnemyMesh.tsx was modified with a StandardZombie redesign that includes separate body segments, necrotic color palette, preserved animations, forward torso lean, and arm swing. However, the diff is truncated and the complete head geometry (eye socket/jaw detail), torn clothing planes, and the entire BossZombie redesign (REQ-2) are not visible in the truncated output. REQ-3 lurch animation appears implemented for StandardZombie in the visible portion.",

      "requirement": "Head geometry includes sunken/hollow eye socket detail (dark recessed geometry) and protruding jaw/lower-face detail",
      "reason": "The diff is truncated before the head mesh JSX is rendered; eye socket geometry and jaw geometry cannot be confirmed as implemented",

      "requirement": "Torn clothing represented by overlapping dark-brown/black geometric planes on the torso and arms",

      "requirement": "Redesign BossZombie with bulkier torso, asymmetric shoulders, oversized arms, deformed skull, emissive glowing red/orange eye geometry, exposed rib/bone geometry, darker necrotic skin tone, and preserved animations",
      "reason": "The entire BossZombie component is beyond the 4000-char truncation limit and cannot be verified as implemented",
