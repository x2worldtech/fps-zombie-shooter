  "summary": "The diff shows WeaponViewModel.tsx was redesigned with realistic Glock-style pistol (with right hand/arm), realistic Mossberg pump-action shotgun (with both hands/arms), and detailed assault rifle (with both hands/arms). The file summary explicitly confirms all three weapon models were implemented. All three REQs appear to be addressed based on the file summary descriptions, though the diff is truncated so full geometry details cannot be verified. No hallucinated features were detected.",
