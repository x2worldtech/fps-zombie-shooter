  "summary": "Both REQ-1 and REQ-2 appear to be fully implemented. The backend XP thresholds were significantly increased with a steep progression curve in backend/main.mo, a migration script was added in backend/migration.mo to preserve existing player data while updating thresholds, and the frontend levelSystem.ts was updated to mirror the exact same 55 thresholds with correct utility functions.",

  "hallucinated_features": [
    {
      "description": "A migration module (backend/migration.mo) was added to handle state migration from old xpThresholds to new hardXPThresholds.",
      "reason": "The build request only asked to increase XP thresholds; it did not request a formal migration module or state migration infrastructure. While preserving existing player XP data is a stated constraint, the specific implementation of a migration.mo module was not explicitly requested.",
